"http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Unreliable."
"3. The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group 'under 1 year' are the number of live births"
"for the given time period. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/cmf.html#Age Group."
"4. Deaths of persons with Age ""Not Stated"" are included in ""All"" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups,"
